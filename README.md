# ArduinoProjects

This is a VisualStudio workspace for personal Arduino projects. 

The projects are developed in Visual Studio using the VisualMicro plugin.
You can find the plugin [here](http://www.visualmicro.com/).

> Everything can be built using Arduino Studio and the files generated by Visual Studio can be ignored.

Each project has its own README.md file so please refer to them for more details.
